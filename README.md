The Farmer and the Snake: My Journey with Hypershell
When helping a struggling startup nearly cost me everything.

Like the farmer who warmed the frozen snake only to be bitten, I learned a painful lesson about trust in the startup world. This is my story as an ex-collaborator with Hypershell and ex-co-founder of IceWhale—based on a true story.

The Distress Call
When Kelvin Sun, founder of Shanghai-based exoskeleton startup Hypershell, approached me for help, I was optimistic and excited. I had known him for quite many years, and he painted a dire picture: "The company won't survive until next May. Nor can we afford the full service crowdfunding agency."

As someone passionate about cutting-edge innovation in the civilian exo space, I agreed to help despite the financial red flags.

What I delivered:

Brand audit, story development and FABE
Pre-launch ads strategy
Commercial video scripts
Press release with media pitch
Complete campaign page production

The agreement? A flat $30/hour instead of the standard industry rate of 5-10% revenue commission. At the time, I thought this was fair—a way to help a struggling startup survive.

I should have known better.

Never Mentioned. Never Fulfilled.
Their Kickstarter campaign raised an impressive $1.3 million. Success, right?

Wrong.

The agreed-upon fees? Never mentioned again. Never fulfilled.

I was left wondering whether I could've done more to ensure accountability upfront. But the real lesson was yet to come.

The Equity Trap
The second blow came from an unexpected direction—my own company, IceWhale Tech.

A shareholder resolution invoked a clause from our corporate bylaws, demanding I transfer my equity for free.

The "evidence" against me? My part-time consultant agreement with Hypershell—twisted into proof of wrongdoing.

Even legal counsel questioned the clause's legitimacy, but the damage was done. The Hypershell collaboration I had entered in good faith had become a weapon against me.

The snake had bitten.

Fake It Until You Make It: Playing Pretend for Investors
During Hypershell's Seed/Pre-A funding phase in 2023, Kelvin made an unusual request:

"Play the role of a freelance photographer/videographer—someone who's a huge fan of hiking. The perfect candidate for a user interview."

I was invited into a group chat, then pulled into a 30-minute investor call to testify how "super useful" their crowdfunded exoskeleton was in my work scenarios.

Staged testimonials. Fabricated user stories. Investors deceived.

This wasn't creative marketing—this was fraud.

It made me question everything about the startup's leadership and integrity. It underscored the importance of rigorous due diligence—a step that often gets overlooked when trust is assumed too early.

The Lessons Learned
For Founders & Consultants:

Written contracts > Handshake deals - Always. No exceptions.
Industry-standard compensation exists for a reason - Don't accept lowball rates out of sympathy
Cash flow "emergencies" can be manipulation tactics - Trust, but verify
Review corporate bylaws before they're weaponized - Protect your equity proactively
Red flags compound - Financial troubles + unusual agreements = trouble ahead
Document everything - Emails, agreements, calls, conversations
Never participate in investor deception - Your reputation is worth more than any favor

Was I naive, or just human?
The farmer saw a creature in pain and chose kindness. I saw an old friend struggling and chose loyalty. Neither of us expected betrayal.

But here's the hard truth: In the startup world, the snake doesn't apologize for its nature.

I balanced optimism with trust—and paid the price. While this chapter involved setbacks, it empowered me with insights I now use to advocate for transparency and accountability in the startup ecosystem.
