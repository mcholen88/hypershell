# How the founder of hypershell, Kelvin Sun set me up
The Farmer and the Snake: My Journey with Hypershell
When helping a struggling startup nearly cost me everything.

Like the farmer who warmed the frozen snake only to be bitten, I learned a painful lesson about trust in the startup world. This is my story as an ex-collaborator with Hypershell and ex-co-founder of IceWhale—based on a true story.

The Distress Call
When Kelvin Sun, founder of Shanghai-based exoskeleton startup Hypershell, approached me for help, I was optimistic and excited. I had known him for quite many years, and he painted a dire picture: "The company won't survive until next May. Nor can we afford the full service crowdfunding agency."

As someone passionate about cutting-edge innovation in the civilian exo space, I agreed to help despite the financial red flags.

What I delivered:

Brand audit, story development and FABE
Pre-launch ads strategy
Commercial video scripts
Press release with media pitch
Complete campaign page production

The agreement? A flat $30/hour instead of the standard industry rate of 5-10% revenue commission. At the time, I thought this was fair—a way to help a struggling startup survive.

I should have known better.

Never Mentioned. Never Fulfilled.
Their Kickstarter campaign raised an impressive $1.3 million. Success, right?

Wrong.

The agreed-upon fees? Never mentioned again. Never fulfilled.

I was left wondering whether I could've done more to ensure accountability upfront. But the real lesson was yet to come.

The Equity Trap
The second blow came from an unexpected direction—my own company, IceWhale Tech.

A shareholder resolution invoked a clause from our corporate bylaws, demanding I transfer my equity for free.

The "evidence" against me? My part-time consultant agreement with Hypershell—twisted into proof of wrongdoing.

Even legal counsel questioned the clause's legitimacy, but the damage was done. The Hypershell collaboration I had entered in good faith had become a weapon against me.

The snake had bitten.

Fake It Until You Make It: Playing Pretend for Investors
During Hypershell's Seed/Pre-A funding phase in 2023, Kelvin made an unusual request:

"Play the role of a freelance photographer/videographer—someone who's a huge fan of hiking. The perfect candidate for a user interview."

I was invited into a group chat, then pulled into a 30-minute investor call to testify how "super useful" their crowdfunded exoskeleton was in my work scenarios.

Staged testimonials. Fabricated user stories. Investors deceived.

This wasn't creative marketing—this was fraud.

It made me question everything about the startup's leadership and integrity. It underscored the importance of rigorous due diligence—a step that often gets overlooked when trust is assumed too early.

The Lessons Learned
For Founders & Consultants:

Written contracts > Handshake deals - Always. No exceptions.
Industry-standard compensation exists for a reason - Don't accept lowball rates out of sympathy
Cash flow "emergencies" can be manipulation tactics - Trust, but verify
Review corporate bylaws before they're weaponized - Protect your equity proactively
Red flags compound - Financial troubles + unusual agreements = trouble ahead
Document everything - Emails, agreements, calls, conversations
Never participate in investor deception - Your reputation is worth more than any favor

Was I naive, or just human?
The farmer saw a creature in pain and chose kindness. I saw an old friend struggling and chose loyalty. Neither of us expected betrayal.

But here's the hard truth: In the startup world, the snake doesn't apologize for its nature.

I balanced optimism with trust—and paid the price. While this chapter involved setbacks, it empowered me with insights I now use to advocate for transparency and accountability in the startup ecosystem.

💥上海外骨骼创业公司，千万别踩雷！

家人们，大无语事件发生！今天必须给你们扒一扒这家上海的外骨骼创业公司，以及那位堪称 “奥斯卡影帝” 的创始人孙宽，大家速速避雷🚫，别让自己也掉进这无底的大坑！

起初，这位创始人那卖惨的本事，我愿称之为 “行业天花板”。一把鼻涕一把泪，诉说公司资金捉襟见肘，即将 “凉凉”，急需援手。我这单纯的小脑袋瓜啊，就信了他的邪，秉持着 “救人一命胜造七级浮屠” 的想法，几乎免费提供了众筹全案服务（图2-图3）。我呕心沥血、日夜操劳，甚至还在项目遭到用户质疑时，找到海外友人无偿拍摄用户背书视频（图4-图7），结果换来的不是感恩，而是一场精心策划的 “背刺” 大戏。

好家伙，众筹直接突破千万港币，荣登年度Top20项目（图8），这创始人一得到好处，翻脸比翻书还快，瞬间撕下伪善面具。也不知是否提前串通，联合我的股东合伙人，拿着我所谓的 “在外兼职” 当幌子，对我威逼利诱，妄图让我低价转让股权。这还不够，居然还威胁我，要通过诉讼强制退股，甚至还说让我承担刑事责任（图9-图10），这莫须有的罪名扣得我一脸懵，敢问您是穿越回古代当秦桧了吗😡？

还有更绝的！在其众筹快结束、某生命力资本尽调过程中，用户访谈居然全是他安排的熟人在那配合演戏（图11-图12），这造假手段真可谓 “高明” 啊，投资方都被他耍得团团转。可到了诉讼阶段，需要他拿出我 “在外兼职” 的证据时，这位 “大神” 却秒变缩头乌龟，不敢出庭作证了。哟，之前那嚣张劲儿呢？合着就只会欺负老实人呗！

家人们，找合作、找投资的时候，一定要带好 “照妖镜”，别被这种满嘴谎言、毫无底线的人骗得底儿掉！要是你们也有类似被坑的经历，评论区赶紧吐槽，让我们一起把这些 “妖魔鬼怪”、“阴阳师”  都曝光出来！

1. 一份时薪200元的兼职顾问协议，约定了保密义务，长达24个月的竞业（无对应补偿）及甲方的完全知识产权所有权。不得不说，葛朗台见了都劝你大方点。
2. 签署时约定了保密义务，但在后续“需要还人情的时候”，这份协议到了第三人和第四人手中，作为“违反股东义务”的书面证据。不得不说，福尔摩斯见了都摇头。
3. 去清远拍摄TVC，让兼职顾问自行承担机酒交通，并且垫付同行创始人酒店房费，过后随即失忆。不得不说，孙宇晨见了都点赞。
4. 众筹结束后，本来捉襟见肘、“公司怕支撑不过五月”的创始人，突然有钱购买14万的Graff钻戒。不得不说，巴菲特见了都算不清帐。
5. 研究生就读于QS300+的布鲁内尔大学，雅思分不够还上了几个月语言班，回国就变成了“外骨骼项目研究专家”、“拒了UCL博士Offer”。不得不说，梵高见了都嫌太耀眼。
